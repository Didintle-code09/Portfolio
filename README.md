# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my web development work, skills, and projects.
Itâ€™s designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate, with sections for:

About Me
Skills
Projects
Contact

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it reflects my style as a developer while keeping the focus on usability and design.
